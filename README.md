# PDF simplifier

### Elevator Pitch
Have you ever had a super long PDF or document that you didn't want to read? What if I told you that there was a website that would read a PDF and make it easier for you to understand and provide an AI assistant for you to ask questions to? This amazing tool is called *pdfsimplifer.click* and it was made for you.

One page will be used for the introduction page. Another page will be for the User's Dashboard. The last page will be for the Login Page.

-**CSS** Application's styling is used in chatboxs, screen headers, PDF displayers, and dynamic colors. 

**JavaScript** Provides login capability, button connections, and collection of text box information. It will also be used to implement the AI chatbox, handle PDF uploads, and make the user experience smoother.

**Service**
    - Login Endpoints
    - Manage User's data.
    - Retrieving the previous PDFs
    - Storing and submitting PDFs

**DB** Will be used to store the User's PDFs and login data.

**Login** Registers and logins the user. User credentials are stored in the database.

**WebSocket** The web socket will be used for real-time communication with the AI assistant.
