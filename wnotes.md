#Here is a first level heading for you notes in CS 260

###Things I learned
Git hub is extremely useful when coding.
I will need to keep and organize my notes the best I can to help me progress in my studies.

##Development and producion enviornments

In commercial wb development it is cruical that you keep you test product and you product seperated. 

Furthermore, companies will do this so that their website can be protected and not destroied and mangled from an malicious programmer

Thus, automated integration (CI) processes were designed. **You should never test or experiment in your production area. Such as you AWS server.**

There is a tutorial about how to implement this better. Here is the link https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/devAndProd/devAndProd.md

##CodePen
*CodePen* is a fantastic way to experiment with all the coding langauges in this class

The unique part about *CodePen* is that it has a small preview window so that you can see what your code looks like

###Portfolio
Another advantage is that you can store you projects here so that you can review it later or share it with others.

##Homework involving *CodePen*
Either create a new pen, or fork an existing example pen.
Conduct the experiment as defined by the assignment.
Save your assignment periodically so that you don't lose any work. In order to keep your CodePen account organized you should consider using pen collections for different technologies.
Submit the pen's URL in Canvas along with a description of some interesting thing that you learned.
